### Computer Vision projects

Thuis projects lists the various techniques to perform tasks from Image Classification to advanced techniques like Image Generation using GAN , Object Detection using SSD, Object Localisation and Image Resoltuion enhancement

The project is work in progress with current capability to perform Image classoification. The project work is ongoing to illustrate some implemenetation of advanced techniques like VCG, ResNet, GAN and SSD using advanced Convolution Neural Network architecture.
